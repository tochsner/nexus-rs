# Nexus Parser

A fast, reliable, and correct parser for the NEXUS file format written in Rust.

## 🔍 Overview

This library provides a robust implementation for parsing NEXUS files, a common format used in bioinformatics and phylogenetics. Our implementation focuses on both correctness and speed, offering significant performance improvements over existing parsers while maintaining strict adherence to the NEXUS file format specification. Currently, we prioritize the Taxa and Trees blocks, with other NEXUS blocks planned for future implementation.

## ✨ Features

- **🚀 High Performance**: Optimized for speed without compromising accuracy
- **📚 Standard-Compliant**: Fully compliant with the NEXUS file format specification
- **💾 Memory Efficient**: Minimizes memory usage even with large datasets
